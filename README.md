# picojvm

> A tiny Java Virtual Machine built from scratch ‚Äî part of the **Bytecode Adventure**.

---

## What is picojvm?

**picojvm** is an **experimental** project:  
the goal is to **rebuild a JVM from scratch**, understanding and explaining each piece of the journey.

Starting from:
- Parsing `.class` files manually
- Interpreting a minimal subset of Java bytecode
- Managing a simple stack frame
- Building a tiny class loader
- Executing basic Java programs

...and eventually compiling the result to a native executable with **GraalVM**.

## Why?

Because the one way to **really** understand something... is to rebuild it.

Through **picojvm**, we explore:
- How a `.class` file is structured
- How bytecode instructions are read and interpreted
- How method calls and stack management work under the hood
- How class loading happens

Along the way, expect mistakes, experiments, and a lot of learning.  
This is a **Bytecode Adventure**, not a perfect reimplementation.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è A humble note

This project is both a technical challenge and a learning journey.
I'm sharing the process as it happens, including possible mistakes and corrections along the way ‚Äî because learning publicly is how we grow.

Feel free to contribute, correct, or simply discuss! üôè
